# Coffee Ice

This is almost the simplest site possible.
Okta Education uses coffee-ice.com as a base domain in training for teaching how to use custom domains.
I wanted a similar domain where I managed the DNS to use for examples outside of class if somebody asked, so I registered <i>coffee-ice.us</i>.
The only thing useful about this website is that it has a good example of a scaling background picture, title, and text built with CSS.

Enjoy!
